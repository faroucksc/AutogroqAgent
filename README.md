## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PocketGroq v0.5.x
- Streamlit
- A valid Groq API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoGroqAgent.git
   cd AutoGroqAgent
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Groq API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your API key: `GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

### Running the Demo

Launch the Streamlit app:
```
streamlit run autogroq_agent.py
```

## Using AutoGroqAgent in Your Projects

While AutoGroqAgent serves as a demo, the real power lies in integrating the AutonomousAgent class into your own projects. Here's a quick example:

```python
from pocketgroq import GroqProvider
from pocketgroq.autonomous_agent import AutonomousAgent

groq_provider = GroqProvider(api_key="your_api_key")
agent = AutonomousAgent(groq_provider)

response = agent.process_request("What are the latest developments in quantum computing?")
for step in response:
    if step['type'] == 'response':
        print("Final Answer:", step['content'])
    else:
        print("Research Step:", step['content'])
```
